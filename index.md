#### About Course-in-a-Box

P2PU created Course-in-a-Box in 2014 as a free and lightweight tool for building online courses. We wanted to preserve the modular structure of MOOCs outside of the bulky (and often proprietary) environment of learning/content management systems. Course-in-a-Box is open-source, and we welcome contributions [on our Github repo](https://github.com/p2pu/course-in-a-box).

p.s. Designing a course for learning circles? [Check out the Learning Circle Course Creation guide](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/116fJM3GS7XDzilUOL_ynMZ0yTncUD6aVUbcQKsTra6U/edit#heading=h.l36tzg40xcgr) for some best practices on course design.
