# AHMP-AIA GIS Course #3
<br>

## **Day 1: Introduction**

- Outline of the course, recap of major skills
- Discussion of how AIA is currently using GIS;
- Discussion of expectations for how that will change;
- File management;
- Comparison of QGIS and ArcGIS functions;
- Review of accessing satphotos within QGIS and capturing georeferenced images.
- Review of the concepts of scale, projections, datums, EPSG codes, and PROJ syntax

Skills: Capture a set of georeferenced satellite images at a set of scales. Probably 1:20K and 1:5K. Learn how to track the coordinates of the corners.

## **Day 2: Integration of site-specific data**

- Digitization: freehand, ortho, ortho-rotated, and respecting the limitations of image-resolution.
- Integrating site-survey data and sat-photo data into vector layers.
- Creating new layers: thinking through Attribute design.
- Creating dropdowns in attribute table. Relational databases and character encoding issues.
- Time series of images: the History function in Google Earth; satphoto dates; other sources.
- Periodization trends: personal photos that show change since last sat-photo; annotation of layers

Skills: digitization (review); attribute table design, creation, and editing (review); search/filter in attribute table; integration of research data

Homework: show georeferenced excavation plan/architectural drawing on modern imagery; show maps of occupation in different time periods

## **Day 3: TAPI pipeline as case study [Jen]**

How this data-set was compiled

(Practical and/or theoretical?) Discussion of relational database structure

Identifying sites based on this data.

Visual assessment of threats to sites—roads, infrastructure, erosion, looting [focusing on Farah province]

(Applying prioritization/triage skills to sites in the TAPI zone—return to this in Day 7)

Skills: site identification, analyzing time series imagery, assessing threats to cultural heritage in satellite imagery

Look at existing Attribute Table critically

Homework: create one or several layers identifying at least 20 sites, with a preliminary assessment of threats and other issues.

## **Day 4: Hydrology**

-Obtaining DEMs (re-visit); image-processing DEMs via symbology settings; 4 types of terrain analysis with DEMs (review).

-Correlation with available hydrology layers

- Flood risk (flow-accumulation analysis), urbanization risk, potential-site identification

Skills: modeling water flow using GIS tools and DEM

Homework: determine areas with high flood or erosion potential in a landscape

## **Day 5: Predictive modeling of an urban environment [Andrew]**

-Simplified version of Gwendolyn Kristy&#39;s research in Herat; apply to Hadda site

Integration of historic maps for identification and evaluation (Corona, Landsat, recent)

Using looters&#39; pits to (A) find sites and (B) evaluate threat

Skills: clipping, buffering, extracting slope values to vector data, use of other geoprocessing tools

Homework: Create a predictive model of urbanization around Hadda

## **Day 6: Remote sensing of the archaeological landscape [Tony]**

Review of electromagnetic spectrum, bands of imagery (near infrared, etc.)

Applications and visualization

-Band combinations

Vegetation indices (NDVI, etc.)

Using multispectral datasets to visualize sites effectively

Specific skills AIA members may want

## **Day 7: Prioritization/triage**

Ian McHarg overlays and identification of priority areas

Clipping to identify high-priority areas from overlays

Directive outcomes (prep for negotiation):

- 100% no-interference zone; highest cultural priority
- Buffer-zones around confirmed/probable sites concentric priority
- Categorically distinct policy arguments:
- Archaeological survey with full documentation before construction
- Archaeological Survey first pre-construction
(a) reserve the right to stop construction indefinitely
(b) reserve the right to conduct a survey before construction

## **Day 8: Re-visit to Day 1 question: How to change AIA GIS usage and why**

##

## **Day 9: Professional ethics in QGIS and Afghanistan**

Building and disseminating data on a website

Privacy, security, and anonymity

## **Day 10: Public maps/dissemination**

Best map making procedures, Leaflet, etc.

[Some material exists]

## **Day 11: Final Project Presentations/Discussion**

More ideas (not yet included in proposed course):

- Least cost paths in QGIS
- Graphical modeler (ModelBuilder)
- Visibility
- More raster analysis, Relief Visualization Toolbox
- Spatial statistics
- Integrating GIS into a pedestrian survey workflow
- StoryMap JS—open-source story map tool
- Integrating new site data/merging databases/cleaning spreadsheets
  - For example, integrating AIA data with AHMP data, removing duplicates, matching sites by coordinate and translated name, etc.
- Having a plugins day for students to explore
