## The Afghan Heritage Mapping Partnership

<br>
The [Afghan Heritage Mapping Partnership (AHMP)](https://oi.uchicago.edu/research/camel/afghan-heritage-mapping-partnership) is a project supported by an institutional grant from the US Department of State and the US Embassy in Kabul to the Oriental Institute since October of 2015. Grant work is carried out in Chicago by the staff of the CAMEL Lab. Kabul-based GIS training funded by the grant is carried out with the cooperation and support of a variety of Afghan partners, including Kabul Polytechnic University.

The Partnership draws on satellite imagery and other geospatial technologies to build a comprehensive geographic information systems (GIS) database of identifiable archaeological sites across Afghanistan. The goals in creating this database are to:

Inventory and map known and previously unknown archaeological heritage sites, especially in areas threatened by future mining development, urban expansion, and looting;
Document the current state of archaeological site preservation and analyze spatial and temporal patterns in looting;
Create a planning tool that will allow heritage protection to be incorporated into mining, economic, and urban development projects; and
Train a cohort of Afghan information technology specialists and heritage professionals in the use of GIS technology for cultural heritage management.
